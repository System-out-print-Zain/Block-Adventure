- All sprites will be block-like.

- The playable character. It can move in any
of the 4 directions and is able to attack with a strike. It
has 3 HP. ?It can also increase the max amount of hp by collecting a certain
item?

- 4 standard enemies, each with its own movement patterns and HP
1) The Grunt: A mindless enemy that moves in a given direction until it
encounters an obstacle, whereupon it turns in the opposite direction
and continues. 1 HP.
2) The Dasher: Dashes from one spot to another within a fixed radius.
It is not impeded by obstacles. 1 HP.
3) The Supervisor. Pursues the player when within range; otherwise it
follows some standard movement pattern.
4)
- A boss enemy, more powerful than the standard enemies.

* When an enemy makes contact with the player, the player
loses some amount of HP depending on the enemy. When the player
strikes an enemy, the enemy loses one health point.

4 areas where standard enemies are located. The boss area can be
accessed only if a key is obtained after killing all enemies in the
4 areas.
